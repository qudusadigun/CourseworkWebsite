<center> <h2>My name is Qudus Adigun, my background is from a Nigerian heritage however I was born in London but I currently live in Manchester.<br>
    <br>
I have always been interested in working behind the scenes in majority of things I have been involved in. <br>
<br>
In University I took the course theatre studies and technical stage production which is the lighting, sound and staging at a theatre, studio or show. <br>
<br>
I am also a DJ which can also be described as behind the scenes as I have to control the music and entertainment for guests at bars, nightclubs, parties etc as opposed to be dancing in the crowd. <br>
<br>
The reason why I am referencing all this is because IT and tech in my opinions is predominantly behind the scenes work, the ability to create something for others or yourself to use. <br>
<br>
I decided to come to Code Nation as I want to get into IT and the tech industry and I believe I could develop my skills and be able to create great things whether they’re websites or apps. <br> </p>
