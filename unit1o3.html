    <b><u><font size="+2"> 3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your
website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
I could have been a lot more productive if we had more time to plan and create the project. <br>
This course was a virtual course. I believe if it was not and we were in a classroom with people around, it could have been a whole to easier to ask complete the task. I would have 
been able to ask for help and communicate with instructors and/or students a whole lot easier. <br>
A drawback of doing it myself is that it was time consuming. We could have created it in teams. If this was done as a group as opposed to by ourselves then would have divided the workload which in turn would have had the website finished 
a whole lot quicker then It currently was. This would have also allowed us to have more and different ideas that could have been incorporated onto the website. <br>
Nonetheless the benefit of doing it by myself is that the content created was entirely my vision and that allowed me to express myself however I saw fit.<br> </p>

<p>    
I could have been more efficient if my time management was better, this would have allowed me complete the questions at a quicker rate and that would have allowed me to use a lot more CSS.<br>
If I had a clearer structure on which sections I would do at certain time, then I also believe the website could have been a lot better. <br>
If I took regular breaks, went away and came back to the my screen (whilst still managing my time) then It would have been a lot easier for me to grasp everything that needed doing. <br>
I could have also minimised the distractions around me, this would have allowed me to be more focused on the tasks at hand. <br>

    <b><u><font size="+2">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
I would get all the writing done first, this would have allowed me to concentrate on focusing on the design aspect knowing that all the written work was done.
I would have asked for help a lot more. I realised towards the end of my deadline that me not doing this because of the thought of looking dumb ended up being more of a hinderance to myself.
I would have also used slack lot more, this would have allowed me to send the draft of my work to the instructors to look over as there was not a limit as to how often I could do that.
I would quit multitasking. I found at time I would do the writing then stress over what the website looked like so then i would simultaneously do both.
I could have also included a lot more javascript to make the website more responsive. 
I would researched how I could do the website for people who might be colour blind. </p>

    <b><u><font size="+2"> 3.4 -  Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
I would save my work repeatedly and then open and refresh the HTML link to the website. This would allow me to make sure everything is working perfectly.
Checking my website on different browsers is another way to test out how the website would look.  
I would ask people around me (family, friends etc) for their feedback. I believe it would be beneficial to get thoughts from people who aren't developers as we they see the finished products of website regularly.
I would also test out my work by checking it for bugs on google chrome's inspect and debugging features. </p>
