    <b><u><font size="+2"> 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </font> </u></b></p>
<p>
Visual Studio Code and Trello are examples of the tools that I used to make my website. Their features helped me in regards to planning and creating it.<br>
In regards to planning, Trello was an influential tool used by me to jot down the different steps I would take to make the website. <br>
Once I finished planning it I started creating the website in Visual Studio Code as it allowed me to implement the three different programming languages which were JavaScript, HTML and CSS. <br> </p>
<p>
However if I did not use Visual Studio Code I could have used CodePen. An advantage of using CodePen is that it is an online code editor. <br>
You could write tiny little bits of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code and have immediate visual feedback. <br>  
A slight negative is that Code pen does not have an auto-complete system and it does not format on save. People tend to use visual studio code to do their projects and then they paste into CodePen to get a quick url. </p>
<p>
Overall, I would say I was happy using Visual Studio Code and Trello as tools in constructing my website. </p>

<p> 
    <b><u><font size="+2"> 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </font> </u></b></p>
<p>
Visual Studio Code was an appropriate tool to use because if I did not use it then I would not have been able to create my website.<br> 
I had a main CSS page and multiple Html pages. The html pages allowed me to present my text (my biography, question and answers to the different sections). <br>
CSS allowed me to implement the structure of how my website was going to look by allowing me to change the colour, size of the text and many other visual aspects. <br> </p>
<p>
Trello allowed me to plan, prep and jot down ideas and it was an appropriate tool to use because if I did not use it as I could have easily forgotten the ideas.  <br>
It allowed me to use the kanban method to organise and plan which steps I was going to take in order to create the best website I could make within the time period that I had. <br>
I had the sections of 'To do', 'Doing' and 'Done' so it allowed me to be organised and see what tasks needed to be done. <br> </p>
<p>
Overall, Visual Studio Code and Trello were definitely appropriate tools that I used to create my website. </p>

<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2"> 2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</font></u></b></p>
<p>
Whilst I was constructing my website in Visual Studio Code I made frequent improvements to my page.<br> 
I would then test this out by saving my work and then opening the HTML link and refreshing my page to see how the changes translates to the website. <br>
I found HTML easier to do however I can admit I was not that great on the CSS side. I came across many difficulties and problems throughout whilst coding as some things were not how I wanted them to be. <br>
Examples of these are: <p>

The initial size of the text that was displayed. The writing size was initially all over the place until I used CSS to fix it. <br>
The background colour that I initially picked was not great. I found that it clashed with the writing. <br>
I made hyperlinks for 'Unit 1' or 'Unit 2' and every time I clicked on the it opened a new tab as opposed to opening the link on the same webpage. <br>
I had to install a nav bar on every page so that I could be easier to navigate without many tabs open for the site. <br>
I also wanted some of my text to be central. I sorted this out by doing some light research on how to do it.<br> 
<p>
Overall, after reassessing my website I would say that I am happy with it. This is the first one I have made and I believe that if I had significantly more time then I could have created a better one. <br></p>

<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2"> 2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
I believe I could have made further improvements to my project. If I had more time I feel I could have added more things onto my page. <b>    
</b>
Examples of these are:
<p>
I had the idea to add a QR code to my website. People can print out the webpages and then later the QR could have been scanned. <br>
This would have allowed my website to be accessed on another device that is not a laptop or desktop. The original webpage would have been able to on a mobile device. <br>
I also had the idea to add a contact me page at the end of my website. This would have allowed potential employers to contact me for jobs or enquiries.<Br>
I could have also added more pictures to the website so it did not feel like there was too much writing. <br>
<br>    
However one thing I'm proud of was I managed to to put a playlist of my different mixes on there, I did not know how to do it until I researched it.<br>
<p>

    <b> <u> <font size="+2"> 2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</font> </u> </b> </p> 
<p>
To review the outcomes and making sure they matched requirements (just like in section '2.3') I would then test out by my work by checking in on google chrome by opening the HTML link and refreshing my page to see how project looked when ran. <br>
I also proof read my work and made sure my wording, spelling and sentences made sense before I handed in my finished piece of work. <br>
I checked my font to make sure it was consistent in various sections throughout the website. <br>
I checked that the links that I embed in the websites all worked perfectly and that they all went to correct target destinations. <br>
<br>
To conclude I would say the website I created matched requirements and was fit for purpose. </p>
