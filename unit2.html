<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2">1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page.</font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
In the content of my website I decided to put an about me section as soon as the user loads up the website. This gives the website a personal feel as the user gets to see see knowledge of my background.<br>
I also added all of my unit question as a navigation bar so users can see where to click for the questions in those sections.<br>
As I am a DJ I decided to include a playlist of my mixes which automatically starts so i could yet again give a personal feel to my website.<br>
All the different unit pages have questions on them that would have been answered. I have made it visual friendly as all the questions are underlined and larger than the answers.<br> </p>

<p>
    <b> <u> <font size="+2">1.2 - Plan and create your website. </font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
When I was planning my website there were a variety of tools and practices I used.<br>
I used Trello to create boards that allowed me to note and jot down the different tasks I needed to complete in order to create a website.<br>
I used the kanban method, this allowed me to have the sections of 'To do', 'Doing' and 'Done, this places all the tasks clearly on my screen.<br>
As I was going on I made sure I updated all the Trello boards moving the different tasks onto the correct sections.<br>
Visual Studio Code also allowed me to create my website as I used javascript, html & css.<br>
Zoom was also a software that helped as the lectures gave us our briefs and help when they held their sessions.<br> </p>

<p>
    <b> <u> <font size="+2">1.3 - Selecting and using website features and structure.</font> </u> </b> </p>   
<p>
I decided to make sure my website had a clear and simple structure. <br>
Using Html I set the questions above with them being underlined and the answers to the questions in paragraphs. <br>
I also made sure the questions were significantly larger than the answers. I also added clickable links so the user can move from one page to the other. <br>
I structured my DJ playlist of my mixes in the middle of my home page as I feel it looked better there and underneath it I then touched on me being a DJ.<br>
    
<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2">1.4 - Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent.</font> </b> </u> </p>
<p>
I made sure that the all the text in the first page was centred whilst the other pages were not. As it was the homepage and about me I felt it should stand out the most <br>
I also made sure the underlining of the questions were consistent throughout the units. <br>
I used the line break function to make sure my sentences were moved onto a new line every time I made a new point. <br> </p>

<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2">1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</font> </b> </u> </p>
<p>
Copyright is when someone creates a piece of original work. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. <br>
Only the owner has the right of the work can use the work in different capacities like selling it, displaying the work in different formats, or recreating said work. <br>
If work is not copyrighted before uploaded to a website it could cause and issue amongst the content owner and the website creator. Which means that the content would have to be take down.<br>
<p>
"Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression. <br>
It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright. <br>
Sometimes copyright protection overlaps with other types of intellectual property. <br>
For example, an online game may contain storylines and music appropriate for copyright registration, but also contains processes that need protection under patent law. <br>
Websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly categorizes them as copyrightable material." <br> </p>

    <b><u><font size="+2">1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can over come them.</font> </b> </u> </p>    
<p>
You could get your website to cater to people will different levels of visual impairment. <br>
Someone might be colour blind so you could have a feature which changes the colours on the webpage. <br>
If their eye sight is bad then you could make sure that the website has larger fonts. <br>
If they're close to being blind or have terrible eyesight the website could have click features, which is a noise that could come up whenever their mouse hovers over a word with a hyperlink. <br>
<br>
If someone did not speak english and your website was in english, you could add a translation button to the website so it changes the text of the language that they speak. This is not a disability,
however it is something that you could incorporate. </p>
 
<p>
    <b><u><font size="+2">1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</font> </b> </u> </p>
<p>
    There are many different types of appropriate filetypes for websites. <br>
    <br>
    Examples of these are: <br>
   <br>
    .AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | 
    .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP. <br>
    <br>
    In regards to images, .jpeg, .png, .svg & .GIF are all examples of appropriate filetypes for websites. <br>
    In regards to languages, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C++, PHP, C., SQL are all examples of appropriate filetypes for websites. <br>
    In regards to videos, MP4, AVI, WebM, WMV and WebVTT are all examples of appropriate filetypes for websites. <br> </p>
<P>
    <b><u><font size="+2">1.8 - Storing and retrieving files effectively.</font> </b> </u> </p>
<p>    
On a day to day basis people store files on hard drives, USBs and local servers so they can access the items they have saved at different points. <br>
Storing and retrieving files online are also saved the cloud, this allows the user to save their work without having to transfer it on a physical device that could be lost, stolen or broken.<br>
On websites the files that are needed to display the website properly in browsers would be hosted on a server. The server then allows it to be called upon and then shown by the browser when the website is in use.<br>
<br>
"Information is a critical business resource and like any other critical resource must be properly managed. 
Constantly evolving technology, however, is changing the way even very small businesses manage vital business information. 
An information or records management system – most often electronic – designed to capture, process, store and retrieve information is the glue that holds a business together."<br>
