<h2> <u>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</u> </h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of IT in modern business can differ. 
                From a company's online presence, the software a business uses to record ingoing and outgoings like payments, or even details stored on servers like the customer’s information. 
                IT has a pivotal role in a business's day to day operations and success. </p>
<p>
                IT can help a company become more productive, increase performance, save money, 
                improve the customer experience, streamline communications and enhance managerial decision-making. 
                It also plays a role in helping companies expand globally and in providing staff access to 
                company information wherever and whenever they need it. </p>

 <h3> <u>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</u> </h3>
            <p>
                To make digital projects successful there are different methods, skills and resources. The essentials are team work, good communication and knowledge. 
                During my time on the Codenation course I created a text based game alongside my work group. We had fantastic team work as we all used division of labour to ration out the workload
                and when one of us was finished we helped the others. This allowed us to finish our work in good time and to be able test out the game. Good communication on google hangouts allowed us work through
                any issues we had with the workload. We also used Trello board to plan and vs code to put it together. Whilst also utilising our skills with the languages javascript, html & css. 
            </p>


<h4> <u>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? include a link to your Trello board.</u></h4>
            <p>
    I planned the design of my website listening to the lectures by our tutors on zoom. I took what they said and used it to plan my own. <br>
    The structure of my website was done using a Trello board, just like in section 1.2 the previous paragraph. (See link for Trello below).
     </p>
<br>

<h5> <u>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</u></h5>
<p> 
    Digital projects could fail for a number of reasons. One example could bugs or hackers, there is a possibility they could crash your website.
    Strong antivirus and internet security would be needed to ensure that does not happen. Another example is communication. Even though the term it is not specific to 'tech' directly, lack of communication could cause disruption amongst a team and that could affect the work or project that is being constructed. 
    Another example could be something as simple as the internet going down, that could affect the work that has been done if companies are working online. 
    If the work isn't saved then that would be a massive inconvenience. They would need to store their work to the cloud which would then allow them to revive their work if something of the sort happens.  

 <h6> <u> 1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </u></h6>       
 <p>  
   
    Selecting IT systems and software entirely depends on the nature of the task at hand. 
    If an IT or tech company employs someone who is contracted to work on the go then a laptop would be the efficient and correct IT tool as they are more mobile as opposed to using a static desktop.        If notes needed to be made then something simple as a pen and pad or a mobile phone would be the correct tool and would suffice and also be efficient if a laptop was not on hand at the moment in time of note taking. 
    An example of software someone could use to work would be javascript, css and html if they were constructing a website. HTML would provided the structure of the sites, 
    CSS would be used to control how it looks and javascript would control the backend and different behaviour of the elements. Another example is if someone was creating android or iOS apps then they would
    different languages. Android apps are generally written in Java as opposed to writing code for Apple apps which apps are written in Swift, Apple's official programming language. </p>
 <br>     
      
<h7> <u> 1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</u> </h7>      
 <p>     
      
    The different technologies I used to help me achieve my outcomes were four-fold. They were Slack, Google hangout, Trello and Zoom.
      <br>
      
      Slack and Zoom allowed me to take in the information and slides from my tutors, as well other members of the class generating ideas. <br>
      Google hangout allowed me to get 1 to 1 help whenever I was stuck on any tasks. This allowed me to move forward with my project.<br>
      Trello was of one the most important ones as I noted down ideas that could be used for the website. Examples of these are different fonts, clickable links, if I decided to use a button or not and many other features that would allow my website to stand out.<br>
      I used kanban to organise and plan which steps I was going to take. I had the sections of 'To do', 'Doing' and 'Done' so it allowed me to be organised and see what tasks needed to be done. <br>

<h8> <u> 1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</u></h8> </p>
<br>      
 <p>  
      
      GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation.

      The 8 basic rights of GDPR
      Under the GDPR, individuals have:
      
    <br> The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
    <br> The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
    <br> The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
    <br> The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
    <br> The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
    <br> The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
    <br> The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
    <br> The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
    <br> The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain. </p>
