    <b><u><font size="+2">1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page.</font> </u> </b> </p>
<p>
In the content of my website I decided to put an about me section as soon as the user loads up the website. This gives the website a personal feel as the user gets to see see knowledge of my background.<br>
I also added all of my unit question as a navigation bar so users can see where to click for the questions in those sections.<br>
As I am a DJ I decided to include a playlist of my mixes which automatically starts so i could yet again give a personal feel to my website.<br>
All the different unit pages have questions on them that would have been answered. I have made it visual friendly as all the questions are underlined and larger than the answers.<br> 
I decided to showcase my work by adding a javascript game that I created with my team during the time on my course.</p>

    <b><u><font size="+2">1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</font> </b> </u> </p>
<p>
Copyright is when someone creates a piece of original work. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. <br>
Only the owner has the right of the work can use the work in different capacities like selling it, displaying the work in different formats, or recreating said work. <br>
If work is not copyrighted before uploaded to a website it could cause and issue amongst the content owner and the website creator. Which means that the content would have to be take down.<br>
<p>
"Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression. <br>
It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright. <br>
Sometimes copyright protection overlaps with other types of intellectual property. <br>
For example, an online game may contain storylines and music appropriate for copyright registration, but also contains processes that need protection under patent law. <br>
Websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly categorizes them as copyrightable material." <br> </p>

    <b><u><font size="+2">1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can over come them.</font> </b> </u> </p>    
<p>
You could get your website to cater to people will different levels of visual impairment. <br>
Someone might be colour blind so you could have a feature which changes the colours on the webpage. <br>
If their eye sight is bad then you could make sure that the website has larger fonts. <br>
If they're close to being blind or have terrible eyesight the website could have click features, which is a noise that could come up whenever their mouse hovers over a word with a hyperlink. <br>
<br>
If someone did not speak english and your website was in english, you could add a translation button to the website so it changes the text of the language that they speak. This is not a disability,
however it is something that you could incorporate. </p>
